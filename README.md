# TicTacToeC++
# Overview
  The goal of this project was to help to familiarize and learn the C++ language. The language has been a programming language that I always wanted to learn. The project is a simplistic tic-tac-toe game that allows you to play on the computer rather then waste paper. I chose this because I got to use a lot of the language by doing so, from functions to if statements and so forth.
